# Module 1 — Introduction to JavaScript

Welcome to your first step into the JavaScript world!  
This module helps you understand **what JavaScript is**, **where it runs**, and **how to execute your first script**.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
1. What is JavaScript & where it’s used  
2. A quick history & ES versions  
3. JavaScript vs other languages  
4. How JavaScript runs (engines, JIT, single-threaded model)  
5. Setting up your environment (Browser & Node.js)  
6. Linking JS with HTML (script tag, defer/async)

## 🧩 Why JavaScript?
- The **language of the web** — used for front-end, back-end, mobile apps, and even IoT.  
- Runs **everywhere** — inside browsers, on servers (Node.js), and more.  
- Known for being **interpreted, dynamic, and event-driven**.

## 🧰 Tools to Install
| Purpose | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Writing code | **VS Code** (with Live Server extension) |
| Running in browser | Any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) |
| Running in terminal | **Node.js** |

---

## 🪄 How JavaScript Runs
- In a **browser**, the JS engine (like V8 in Chrome) reads and executes your script line by line.  
- In **Node.js**, the same engine runs JS outside the browser to build servers and tools.  
- JavaScript is **single-threaded** but can handle multiple tasks asynchronously (using callbacks, promises, etc.).

## 🧾 Exercises
1. Print “Hello, World” in console and on the webpage.  
2. Run the same code in Node.js using `node hello-world.js`.  
3. Try changing the position of the `<script>` tag (top vs bottom) and watch the console output order.

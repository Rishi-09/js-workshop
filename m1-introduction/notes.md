Welcome to your first step into the JavaScript world!  
This module helps you understand **what JavaScript is**, **where it runs**, and **how to execute your first script**.

# 🧠 Module 1 – Introduction to JavaScript

Welcome to your first step into the JavaScript world!  
In this module, you’ll learn what JavaScript is, how it works, where it’s used, and how to write your very first program.

## 🪄 What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript (JS)** is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.

While HTML gives structure and CSS gives style, **JavaScript adds life** to a webpage — it allows buttons to work, animations to play, and data to update without refreshing.

> 💡 Think of JavaScript as the brain of a webpage — it tells everything what to do and when.

## ⚙️ Features of JavaScript

| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Interpreted** | Code is executed line by line by the JS engine. |
| **Lightweight** | Doesn’t require compilation or heavy setup. |
| **Dynamic** | Variables and types can change at runtime. |
| **Event-driven** | Reacts to user actions like clicks and keypresses. |
| **Cross-platform** | Runs on any OS or browser. |

## 🧩 Why JavaScript?
- The **language of the web** — used for front-end, back-end, mobile apps, and even IoT.  
- Runs **everywhere** — inside browsers, on servers (Node.js), and more.  
- Known for being **interpreted, dynamic, and event-driven**.

## 🧰 Tools to Install
| Purpose | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Writing code | **VS Code** (with Live Server extension) |
| Running in browser | Any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) |
| Running in terminal | **Node.js** |

## 🧩 History of JavaScript

| Year | Event |
|------|--------|
| **1995** | JavaScript was created by *Brendan Eich* at Netscape in just 10 days. |
| **1996** | Microsoft introduced JScript for Internet Explorer. |
| **1997** | ECMAScript standard was introduced to unify JavaScript versions. |
| **2015** | **ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)** introduced modern features — `let`, `const`, arrow functions, etc. |

Now JavaScript runs everywhere — browsers, servers, mobile apps, even robots!

## 🖥️ Where JavaScript Runs

JavaScript can run in two major environments:

1. **Browser Environment**
   - Built-in JavaScript engines in browsers execute JS code.
   - Example engines:
     - Chrome → V8  
     - Firefox → SpiderMonkey  
     - Safari → JavaScriptCore  
   - You can write JS directly inside `<script>` tags in an HTML file.

2. **Node.js Environment**
   - Node.js allows JavaScript to run **outside the browser**, on a computer or server.
   - It also uses the **V8 Engine** (same as Chrome).

---

## 🪄 How JavaScript Runs
- In a **browser**, the JS engine (like V8 in Chrome) reads and executes your script line by line.  
- In **Node.js**, the same engine runs JS outside the browser to build servers and tools.  
- JavaScript is **single-threaded** but can handle multiple tasks asynchronously (using callbacks, promises, etc.).

---

## 🧰 Setting Up JavaScript

You can write and run JS in two ways:

### 1️⃣ Using the Browser Console
- Open any browser (like Chrome).
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + J` (or `Cmd + Option + J` on Mac) → Console tab.
- Type:
  ```js
  console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");


---

## 🧾 Exercises
1. Print “Hello, World” in console and on the webpage.  
2. Run the same code in Node.js using `node hello-world.js`.  
3. Try changing the position of the `<script>` tag (top vs bottom) and watch the console output order.

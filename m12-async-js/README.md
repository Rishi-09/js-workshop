# Module 12 — Asynchronous JavaScript

## Overview
Handling tasks that take time (I/O, timers, network) without blocking the main thread is crucial. This module covers callbacks, promises, async/await, error handling for async code, fetch API basics, and working with JSON.

### Topics Covered
1. Callbacks
2. Promises (`then`, `catch`, `finally`)
3. Async/Await syntax
4. Error handling using try...catch with async
5. Fetch API (GET/POST) — demo later in APIs module
6. JSON parsing and stringifying

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand callback pyramid & how promises simplify control flow.
- Use async/await for cleaner code and handle errors correctly.

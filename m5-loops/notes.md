# Module 5: Loops

## Why Loops?

- Loops make it easy to repeat actions without writing the same code again.

## for Loop

- Repeats code a set number of times.

## while Loop

- Repeats code as long as a condition is true.

## do...while Loop

- Like `while` but runs at least once.

## for...of Loop

- Loops through each value in an array (or similar collection).

## for...in Loop

- Loops through each property/key in an object.

## break and continue

- `break` stops the loop early.
- `continue` skips to the next loop pass.
